* (STY-"24Nov21") HADES, the Holder of All Dark and Evil’s Son The Holder of All Dark and Evil’s Son held the whole multiverse. He thought everything should be in darkness because of dark heart. Even though he was full of darkness, he did have some positive energy. His energy allows him to create new universe, new people, new gods. He created four gods; Lasiclub **{1}\[M\]**, Blacusio, Sablouci, and Usablico (all of them have a anagram of Lasiclub) (11/24/21 \- 8:18 pm) **\[$\](5/4/25 \- 7:00 pm)**

* (STY-"24Nov21") All of them took the energy from the Holder. Each one had more darkness in their soul than light, except one. Blacusio had much more light which makes him more positive than negative. (11/24/21 \- 8:18 pm) **\[$\](5/4/25 \- 7:01 pm)**

* (STY-"24Nov21") The Holder commands the gods to destroy his universes with the power of darkness. Universes would already have plenty of positive energy because they are the Holder’s creations (positive energy.) The gods destroyed each one, then another, then another, for fun\! "It’s fun to create things then destroy them." Blacusio didn’t like the idea of destroying because it was too dark. He insteads use his little bit of positive energy on another being. In the parallel universes Blacusio were command to destroy, there were four kids. One was named Byrus, another named Tyre, Rose **{4}\[M\]**, and Usoux. They became Blacusio’s "chosen ones" because they fell into the "Abyss of the Unfinished". The Abyss of the Unfinished is called that is where the whole universe ends, but it’s not finished so it’s just a black abyss. No one ever mentioned or saw the Abyss of the Unfinished, except these kids. Blacusio gave them powers using his energy. The energy could’ve been negative energy, or it could have been positive energy, but it’s random (11/24/21 \- 8:18 pm) **\[$\](5/4/25 \- 7:02 pm)**

* (STY-"24Nov21") Cyrus got the power to create, Tyre got the power to destroy, Rose got the power of conversion, and Usoux had the pothe best power of all. Usoux got a special power, without him, the Holder will still stand with terror, with darkness. Usoux had the power to access the outside world; the real word; outside the game itself. Usoux was very lucky to get that power, **{2}\[XE\]** and he was able transfer a real human (the player) into the game. When Blacusio bought back the kids, they were accidentally sent into another parallel universe where nobody knew they even existed. Using Cyrus’s power, he made a mansion for them to live in. The had lots of fun inside **\[XE\]**, then Usoux and Rose got married… (11/24/21 \- 8:32 pm) **\[$\](5/4/25 \- 7:30 pm)**

* (STY-"24Nov21") The had a son named Usoux Jr, but he died by Usoux forcing Rose to use her power of conversion to make him smarter but instead died. After that happened, Rose divorced Usoux; Tyre and Pyre also left the mansion because too many bad things happened there, including Usoux Jr’s death. Later, like 5 years, Usoux changed the mansion to a lab to test experiments **{3}\[+\]**; And to find a way to get his son back. More years later, an evil conqueror, Blacusio, came down to the world to cover the whole world in darkness. Blacusio was forced to destroy the world or he’ll die by the Holder. Usoux was worried about Blacusio, and he wanted to stop him himself so he can show Rose he’s still a good man. He thought about creating a powerful robot army with a high defense. (11/26/21 \- 1:55 am) **\[$\](5/4/25 \- 7:34 pm)**

* (STY-"24Nov21") So he started creating multiple robots called "Robotro (singular); Robotri (plural)", but because it took forever, he made four then stopped. **{233}\[+\]** (11/26/21 \- 1:58 am) **\[$\](6/11/25 \- 8:00 pm)**

When the humans came back to grab more alien species, they attacked the humans. The humans and alien had a war (there were only like 3 humans.) The humans were much stronger than the aliens, but the King killed them all with his magic staff he obtained. After you defeat Usoux in the Dark Matter Run, he would lose his powers and teleport into another another timeline. It was the timeline before the Humans attacked Magolia. He knew that humans are very strong and evil, so he created a weapon for the king to use to defeat all humans. All humans, or anything that looks like a human, will be sentence to death.

* (STY-"3Dec21") **{7}\[XE\]** Dark matter. With the power of Negative Energy, Dark Matter will take over everything. Negative Energy brings the harm. You’re stronger when you’re mad, than when you’re happy. Dimension 1\. Humans have lived in this dimension for over 520 trillion years. They learned new things each day, and they know more than any other dimension. With the power of electricity, they made a program that found a way to access the whole multidimension. They visit new dimensions with different beings. They stole those beings and brought them to their own dimension for experimentation. Over 100,000,000 years later, They noticed a Dark Matter taking over many dimensions. The humans tried to destroy the dark matter, but they then became apart of it. The humans didn’t know what to do. One human, in the name of… (12/3/21 \- 7:03 pm) **\[$\](5/5/25 \- 5:36 pm)**

They know more things than all the other dimensions. They found a way how to control all other dimensions. They can create new dimensions by taking pieces of other dimensions. Creator didn’t like that, so he created a human to tell everyone that creating new dimensions with others is wrong. Human came out from the sky, and everyone nearby was looking at her. She told everyone that she is the creator’s messenger. She also told them to stop, but she ended up doing the same thing. Creator got mad. He got so mad that he moved some the new dimensions together, and created a black hole. The hole was massive and a glowing eye popped out of it. Dark matter came out from the black hole then went out for all dimensions. The Creator was happy. Humans noticed about the Dark matter… (12/3/21 \- 7:22 pm) **\[$\](5/5/25 \- 5:44 pm)**

Person unleashes Dark Matter accidentally, then the Person tries to use negative energy to destory it. The Dark Matter gains more power, then kill the Person. The Dark Matter now has the Person’s power. The Dark Matter forms in human bodies, then spits apart to create more Dark Matter.

* (STY-"3Dec21") New dimensions mean new people. There was one dimension full of alien people. There was one person named Denson. He was a scientist who liked learning about extraordinary things. He was married to a woman named Syra. Syra somehow gained a power to change things to something else. They both had a son named Seison. Seison was a quiet kid at school. When he was younger, he made lots of mistakes and people made fun of him. When he became 11, he went to middle school. He wanted to start a new school year with less participating in groups and more independent. He still makes mistakes, and he doesn’t finish his work. He had lots of bad grades, and his parents noticed that. Denson was mad at Seison, but he had an idea to fix it. EXPERIMENT 127: He would use Syra’s power of conversion to change Seison’s mindset. Syra and Seison didn’t like that idea, but Denson forced them to do it. Syra used her powers on Seison, then he turned Human. (Humans are banned in the world of Magolia) (12/3/21 \- 9:01 pm) **\[$\](5/5/25 \- 5:48 pm)**

Dec 4th 2021 (STORY STARTS): **{10}\[+\]** The first dimension was full of humans. They knew more things than any other dimension. They found a way how to access different dimensions. Astronauts came to different worlds full of unknown aliens. They brought them back to their own dimension to experiment them. Lots of dimensions banned humans for ever coming to their worlds. (Humans are banned. If you find a human, kill or report it. Worth 13,000 vexias.) One scientist, named Joe, in the first dimension was called a clown.

Visible dark matter came to the first dimension and the first person it came to was Joe. Joe had thoughts from the dark matter. The dark matter told him he was right about everything being a game. (Dec 4th 2021\) The dark matter teached Joe about new things, then Joe became a god. Joe messes up with time-lines of different dimensions. He mixes up dimensions, creating new ones. Person unleashes all Dark Matter accidentally, then Joe tries to use negative energy to destory it. The Dark Matter gains more power. The Dark Matter takes Joe’s power, and Joe is now powerless. The Dark Matter flicked him onto the world of Varxia (a mixed up dimension). The Dark Matter forms in human bodies, then spits apart to create more Dark Matter. They were sent to take over all dimensions- and they almost succeeded. Joe landed on Varxia, and he knew humans were banned there. He hid from all Varxians, and found a way to transform into one. He made a machine to transform into a Varxian. He became a clown-looking monster. He then changed his name to "Bippy" **{12}\[M\]**.(12/4/21 \- 12:56 pm) **\[$\](5/5/25 \- 5:52 pm)**

* (STY-"3Dec21") Stella, a little girl who was also possessed by the darkness. Before she was possessed, she was a thief. She stole lots of candy for years (like probably 3,000 dollars of candy) One day, she saw the most beautiful candy that looked like a jem. She ate the candy, but it was tasteless. It wasn’t a piece of candy, it was a gem. One of the many gems left by God. It gave Stella powers, the powers to see the player’s mind. She has been asleep for years until the player came onto the world of Varxia. Stella was still an little girl. She was lost in the modern world. Her parents died years ago and her home is currently in used by another family. Stella asked help to many people, but they didn’t care one little bit. Some abused her, and others treated her like scum. She thought the world of Varxia was a cruel place, so she ran off. She didn’t know where to go, until she saw a dark alley. Stella entered the alley way; it was perfect for her. **{22}\[+\]** (12/10/21 \- 2:49 pm) **\[$\](5/5/25 \- 8:49 pm)**

* (STY-"3Dec21") **\[\#\] 22 \>** No one comes there because people say the alley is full of dangerous monsters. Lots of people didn’t believe it, and others did; but it was really a lie. Stella lives inside of the dark alley. No one had entered the alley until a group of seven graders dared each other to observe it. One in the name of “Mitchell” entered the alley with a flashlight. Mitchell pointed the flashlight forward and Stella appeared. She didn’t know what to do; she was scared. So she screamed. Mitchell ran away terrified and told his friends that there is a dangerous monster inside of the dark alley. Then Stella had an idea. Stella pretends to be a dangerous monster so she can scare off individuals. There were news stories and everything. After the “Robot Hero” thing became popular. Stella would eventually come out with a mask on her face so nobody can recognize her. Stella has watched the player, and she has seen lots of nice things the player has done. She thinks that the player is really the only thing nice about the world. She likes how cool the robot is, and she really likes him (in a loving way). She knows that the robot is an actual living being. She thinks that there is someone inside of the robot. She thinks that she can keep the robot for herself. The “Robot Hero” had so many fanboys and fangirls. There were a little too many, and that was annoying to Stella. (12/10/21 \- 3:12 pm) **\[$\](5/5/25 \- 8:51 pm)**

Negative energy may be stronger than positive, but positive energy doesn’t need strength to win. That’s what most heroes don’t realize. So if that’s the case, will darkness surpasses the light?

(LST) The **Romi Constant** was created. Ever since I viewed powerscaling posts regarding infinite power on Reddit, I aimed to truly understand what infinity is, and it came to mind once I figured out about infinitesimals (0.000…1). Originally I didn't know that they were a widely known thing, so I thought that I invented something crazy. I intially would use the letter "R" to represent the infinitesimal (epsilon), but then I decided "R" to represent the transfinity (omega) **\[$\](3/20/25 \- 9:37 pm)**

(BUB) Rochant Values were originally used for powerscaling. Characters with infinite power, like Satoru Gojo with Infinite Void, would not truly be the greatest power one could have, for Rochant uses all types of infinity – exponentation. One who is has 5R^1 unit speed would look five times faster to one who has 1R^1 unit speed (assuming they both have the moving speed and processing speed). However, one with 10R^0 speed (the same thing as just 10 unit speed) would see both the 5R^1 unit and 1R^1 unit as infinite (instant) speed. Of course, this would only work in a fictional world with these rules, as our world is full of limits and other contradicting rules you would have to consider. **\[$\!$\](4/19/25 \- 1:36 pm)** 

(BUB) Let's imagine that we think in a way where all this stuff in our reality is taken from a source that has absolutely everything: the infinity. So like, if we have one apple, we would think of it as: "We have infinity-1 apple", since we taken one apple away from the infinity. However, the thing is, you know you can replace the infinity with a zero (absolute nothingness). So if you say "infinity minus anything finite is still infinity", that's the same thing as saying "zero plus anything is still zero". The only reason why that may feel wrong is because our cultures and mathematics are used to the realistic approach: building on upon nothing – compared to the unrealistic approach: withdrawing from everything, as if there is everything. **\[$\!$\](4/19/25 \- 2:37 pm)**
