## Actually Created At That Time

* (STY-"\_TL") *\<And this world repeats itself once again\>* (11/30/23 \- 12:00 am)

* (STY-"Uer") There begins a small and very peaceful world. It was a world with an absence of problems, a community that everyone sees lovely and beautiful, a utopia. However, not but many years ago, the world was …nowhere similar **\[FXE\]**… …in havoc **\[FXE\]**… different. Instead, it was a cruel and sickened place, for great chaos would roam across the lands and …criminals would cause evil **\[XE\]**… among the citizens. But, fortunately, it all ended, peacefully and effectively once the great and extraordinary new ruler had discovered and banished the problem with his powers. It was all caused by merely one horrible man with an unspeakable name. Now exiled and surely reached death, the king would expect to not encounter this malevolent spirit once ever again and forever. (3/21/24 \- 12:02 am)

* (STY-"Ham") (The Great Reality is this reality, the one where I am talking to you …AI **\[FXE\]**… . …The souls are **\[XE\]**…) (This plan, the Engroezing plan, is just another way of saying the plan to attract people to play my game.) (7/15/23 \- 12:04 am)

* (STY-"T5") Is it me, or is it getting way too noticeable that everyone is trying too hard to be funny in those comments? Not even just the comments, but the media, plus relationships in general? It seems a bit… um… I don't know how to explain it. But, of course we want to be funny. As we tend to lack any useful response, what else should we comment about? I think I understand now. Humor is nothing but filler. — **"Maela, are you writing that because you're just jealous that everyone else is funny, unlike you?"** // "No\! I mean… if I was funny, I probably wouldn't have… but… I mean, NO\!" (8/24/25 \- 12:05 am)

(IMG) "spine.png" (The popular SPINE NUBLIK) \- (Created with Clip Studio Paint) [(LINK)](https://dekauermaelab.github.io/Public/IMG/spine.png) (4/25/25 \- 12:07 am)

* (STY-"Understanding") I know someday, after trying to share my beliefs towards others, beliefs that were formed in the making of my story, they will tell me that this story development is bad for me. Either it happens, like I said, or it doesn't, which is fine by me… (3/25/25 \- 12:09 am)

* (STY-"**\[R'\]**") **\[UICH\]** Kanneno (Kann-) (to be able) (3/2/24 \- 12:10 am)

* (STY-"Understanding") (How she looks at the mirror, making faces and weird movements acting how she would be when she gets popular.) "Do you think it's bad that my confidence makes me do these things?" // **"Yes…"** // "Aww… I really thought you would say no after the hundredth time…" (4/14/25 \- 12:11 am)

* (STY-"Understanding") "You say all of this… make me go through all of this… and you don't use these moments to change you? After all of this… you will still be the same lonely person you've always been?" (4/5/25 \- 12:12 am)

* (STY-"T6") (Fashion design, where is it?) — The costumes, absolutely horrid. That red jacket definitely needs to go. So bland, my God. (9/15/25 \- 12:13 am)

* (STY-"Understanding") Generations lose abilities as we create easier methods to do things. Like how Gen Z is adapted to typing and using slang, weakening their ability to write. So what would it be in the future? (4/3/25 \- 12:14 am)

* (STY-"Eiahen") Late on a school night, **Maela's** eyes closed, headphones on, inches away from the computer screen, listening to distractedagain.flp. Remembering it was a friday when it was created, moments of departure and separation, she imagines a video where she appears with her music. Not a nobody anymore, others recognizing what she can do, this specific girl can do. She stands on her chair, eyes still closed, moving with the music. A beautiful moment it was, until she accidentally fell off, a loud thud. Scrambling to find the computer plug to pull, rushing to bed before anyone catches her, I still saw everything. Smiling at her, so silly, then suddenly I'm her, late on a school night, listening to distractedagain.flp, but with my eyes open. Bottom right, the time, the time. The time. (10/13/25 \- 12:15 am)  

* (STY-"Eiahen") I just can't explain. Overwhelmed, I'm getting very tired now. (10/11/25 \- 12:17 am)

* (STY-"T4") How something problematic, abnormal, uncommon, all the things that can make one stand out, can create one's identity. But, the moment they lose that feature, "who am I?", they say to themselves. The materials, physical attributes, literally anything as we can wield it and lose it, all our idols. Knowledge as material, the love and connections that we cherish, literally everything that makes us proud of ourselves is our possessions. There is no other way to have pride, our self-worth, without it. — Ownership. (7/8/25 \- 12:19 am)

* (STY-"Ham") Continuing on the story. Amgods have the power to set the variables of their reality to however they wants. They can change the world’s gravity, weather, etc. They can also change how people think, as Amgods also act as an influencer of their society. (7/15/23 \- 12:20 am)

* (STY-"Understanding") **Maela**, often with her shoes untied, noticing that everyone has their shoes tied except one other person. She stares at them with happiness, acceptance, and connection. — "Don't tell me you like him because he got untied shoes…\!?" (4/5/25 \- 12:21 am)

* (STY-"Understanding") How we believe that the bully, the one who gains superiority, should get humility. (4/2/25 \- 12:23 am)

* (STY-"Ham") **\[XE\]** After **\[XE\]** ran out from the tower, **\[XE\]** were shrieking in fear as the **\[XE\]** melted down into an unknown dark liquid called ink. (5/20/23 \- 12:24 am)

* (STY-"T2") That moment, a dream, I imagined a problem was fixed, a grade now raised up, no more worry. I wake up and I wonder if that was reality. (5/28/25 \- 12:25 am)

* (STY-"**\[R'\]**") Kannech Caeleno Nandant Videno (I cannot fly nor see) (3/2/24 \- 12:26 am)

* (STY-"16Apr22") Crystals — The Light (4/16/22 \- 12:27 am)

* (STY-"T4") Cognitive Dissonance. How must I speak when I don't have a mouth? Scared of the ones who knew me before, a positive change, great popularity, I show towards the new. The ones who knew me before, confused with envy I believe, as they wonder why couldn't just be like that around them? (7/9/25 \- 12:28 am)

(MUS) "10.7.25.1.43.mp3" (My SECOND recorded piano piece. This recording was taken place in school. Although the music was played by me on the keyboard, the audio was internally created with FL Studio) [(LINK)](https://dekauermaelab.github.io/Public/MUS/10.7.25.1.43.mp3) (10/7/25 \- 1:43 pm)

---

* (STY-"T") "I know you can see me" // **"Maela… stop talking to the wall…"** // "I'm not talking to a wall… …" // **"And she continues to talk to a wall…"** (4/22/25 \- 2:00 pm)

(MUS) "9.25.25.2.25.mp3" (My FIRST recorded piano piece. This recording was taken place in school. Although the music was played by me on the keyboard, the audio was internally created with FL Studio) [(LINK)](https://dekauermaelab.github.io/Public/MUS/9.25.25.2.25.mp3) (9/25/25 \- 2:25 pm)

---

* (STY-"T2") Generation Omicron, starting 2120\. (5/16/25 \- 4:00 pm)


* (STY-"Eiahen") Uncanny Valley. Our fight responses towards things that seem fake or dead. The Dolls, the AI videos, our feelings make us see the warning. (10/24/25 \- 4:02 pm)  
    
* (STY-"Eiahen") The moment in the bus they were talking about God. A normal interaction, their small theories, juxtapositioning my ideas that revolve around this story. This is what should appear in **\[R'\]**. (10/27/25 \- 4:05 pm)

(MUS) An Adventure Awaits (Sheet music I had created years ago, around the time I started getting into composing music) [(LINK)](https://www.noteflight.com/scores/view/ae3e4eea81bb727fedb5e5af1c5d276938d39543) (5/15/21 \- 4:08 pm)

* (STY-"T4") How they surrender to their God. Their only hope, the great Deus (ex Machina). — I don't care what you believe or not. There's a reason why we're skeptical of these religious beliefs. It's obviously ridiculous. Even religions call other religions ridiculous by their conflicting beliefs as well. — Yet… it works. Why? Because it allows us to believe in something higher, something greater, something that makes us feel special, something that makes us have meaning. — It's all a placebo effect. A great placebo effect. All of this brings me the great question: can we raise ourselves up without this placebo? (8/3/25 \- 4:10 pm)  
    
* (STY-"Understanding") I should acknowledge that any concept will or already has appeared in various media. No concept will be special, thus you must assume there are infinite stories with that idea. Making it feel unique would limit it greatly. (4/12/25 \- 4:13 pm)  
    
* (STY-"T3") Although the story uses **\[R'\] \[XE\]**, a futuristic dialect of English, as its language, it will be translated to the normal languages in our world, like Modern English. In certain texts outside the text bubbles, it would show **\[R'\] \[XE\]** and how it differs a lot from Modern English. This makes it easier for there to be translations for other languages like Spanish and Korean. (6/16/25 \- 4:16 pm)

* (STY-"T") The struggle when you try to cheer someone up after they get so mad that they don't want any interaction with you. You can't cheer them up. All you can do is hope they feel better by everything else. But wait a minute. There is still a small chance you can secretly influence other people and things to make them cheer up without them knowing it was all by you. You just need to make it so that you are a part of everything else, not yourself. (5/8/25 \- 4:18 pm)

* (STY-"Eiahen") Speaking and acting as if their partner were a child, someone lesser than you. Then have the nerve to blame them for not standing up for themselves… — Why must I give those character traits to **\[XE\]**? He is a good person… (9/28/25 \- 4:19 pm)

* (STY-"T5") **\[XE\]**2 song… created. — Oh, of course **\[XE\]** gets another theme… What did he even do to deserve that\!? (8/28/25 \- 4:21 pm)

* (STY-"History of R'") Inspired by **\[XE\]**, the character "You" would live in a Red Dog House with his pal **\[XE\]**. "You" would fight against many monsters, including some characters like **\[XE\]** and **\[XE\]** (4/23/24 \- 4:23 pm)

* (STY-"T3") I was today years old when I found out that many countries and states are separated by rivers or mountains. No wonder some borders look so crooked and irregular. (7/7/25 \- 4:24 pm)

* (STY-"Understanding") *\<I'm watching both of them. You're watching both of them. Are you the admission counselor, or are you just another person?\>* — "I'm scared of them. They're judging me. They are all judging me, and I can't see their reactions. I can't do anything right because they're always watching me" // **"Maela… there is no one else but me. Don't be scared"** (4/8/25 \- 4:25 pm)

* (STY-"Understanding") **\[XE\]** Her actions and words— influencing mine I share to you, as she's held hostage somewhere unknown that I cannot share. An experiment using her and the audience, entertainment as it baffles everyone. Of course, it's not true. It's all just me making you believe that it is true, so this story would rise and people would care. But what if I am lying? Don't be concerned. Be in awe. (4/16/25 \- 4:26 pm) 

* (STY-"History of R'") \<Title?\> \*\*\*Each story has a meaning?\*\*\* (4/23/24 \- 4:29 pm)

* (STY-"T") You never see franchised music in the public, but you see non-franchised music in brands. So how would you make your franchised music popular like the non-franchised ones? Well, a good example is social media, as many creators would use music from video games and movies for background music. Background music– it's the only way, for it's something that isn't only listenable, but something people can use. (Media Theory) (4/26/25 \- 4:30 pm)

* (STY-"Eiahen") What sounds will **\[R'\]** make? **\[R'\]** needs iconic sounds. (10/1/25 \- 4:31 pm)

 

* (STY-"Ham") …the **\[XE\]**… a royal cloak (5/19/23 \- 4:33 pm)

 

* (STY-"History of R'") Inspired by **\[XE\]**, the great team of kids that would say the universe. The Chosen Humans: **\[XE\]** of Strength, Molly of Defense, **\[XE\]** of Speed, **\[XE\]** of Healing. (4/23/24 \- 4:35 pm)

* (STY-"Understanding") Martians– moving to Earth before humans existed, trying to escape as Mars is becoming uninhabitable? (4/17/25 \- 4:36 pm) 

* (STY-"2Jun22") **\[XE\]** You wake up in a dream, where (6/2/22 \- 4:38 pm)

* (STY-"T4") **Xeradus**, personification of stagnation. (7/22/25 \- 4:39 pm)

 

* (STY-"Eiahen") Dealing with the audience. The anxiety it would be after seeing feedback. Yet, I'm not the one sharing the work. **Maela** is… (9/25/25 \- 4:41 pm)

* (STY-"Ham") \*(In the book, there is a shadow of a …woman **\[XE\]**… person with a big crown, a Y on their forehead, and two horns above everyone else on the page. Under the shadow …woman **\[XE\]**… person with Xs on their foreheads and small crowns. The shadow person, who lives closely near the sun that anyone else, impales each person …with a X **\[XE\]**… with its horns. Next to the horns, there are words that say “surb” in a mysterious font (**\[U\]** already had solved).)\* (5/19/23 \- 4:42 pm)

* (STY-"T4") A RPG battle game where you have to write sentences to act. (And it's not going to be AI. Why use AI if I have a manual called "Linguistics"? I mean, I will manually add the words…) (8/3/25 \- 4:43 pm)

* (STY-"Eiahen") How I always put my hand on my face when sitting near a desk. "**\[NOME\]**, can you please take your hand off your face? I can't hear you." **Maela**, legs together, straight posture, or maybe…  what kind of habit would she have, future me? (9/14/25 \- 4:44 pm)

* (STY-"T2") I'm going insane\! Really\!? Why the heck does **Xeradus** exist\!? I drew her. – Me, broken from the real world, **Xeradus** just floats there.  (5/27/25 \- 4:46 pm)

* (STY-"T3") Tweets of **\[XE\]**, MP3s of **\[XE\]**, and many others, ingrained in our society and put in fictional worlds. Those words aren't just random things we can just use. Those are owned by actual companies. Occasionally, you see creators do care about copyright as they would create something like the "Bintendo Twist", but many people don't realize the many others that were copyrighted or owned that they've used. Many common words are like that as well, and it's just so amazing how we don't even know about that. (6/28/25 \- 4:47 pm)

* (STY-"Ham") The **\[XE\]** weren't called the **\[XE\]**. Instead, they were just called "Gods". …The strengh **\[XE\]**… Their realities were filled with communities who would worship the "Gods". However, not everyone would (7/22/23 \- 4:48 pm)

* (STY-"10Apr22") Long ago, there was a man named **\[U\]**. …We was friends on **\[XE\]**... He was friends with **\[XE\]**, **\[XE\]**, and **\[XE\]**. He married **\[XE\]** when he was 26; he had a daughter named **Myla**. (4/25/22 \- 4:49 pm)

* (STY-"T7") In that house, there are those paintings. In this house, there are clues. Looking around, the house made as a mystery, yet they wouldn't notice. **\[?\]** \< What is this? (10/22/25 \- 4:50 pm)

* (STY-"T6") (Why am I trying to make **\[R'\]** the greatest?) The power. The power… is Useless? Meta-narrative, self-awareness, probably the highest form of giving an impression, yet… I just have a feeling it won't work, it won't impress that… **\[XE\]**… (Are you seriously still talking about her? This is actually getting out of hand. Hopefully this doesn't mean that you're abandoning **\[R'\]**) —You're telling me that he wasn't **Xeradus** this whole time? Who is he? Just a random person\!? (9/11/25 \- 4:51 pm)

 

* (STY-"T4") A story of attachment. Grown up, everyone moved on, except her. Popularity strikes upon the quiet kid, vengeance erupts against everyone else. It's now the quiet kids story, the hero of reality, fantasy as everyone from her highschool plays as characters under her. The story of attachment, her crush as the prince who must be saved. — The students fail to escape. The students fail to escape (7/9/25 \- 4:53 pm)

 

* (STY-"T5") My **\[R'\]**. What will be **\[R'\]** thing? What will be **\[R'\]** icon? What will be the thing that lets the audience know that it's **\[R'\]**? — Let's a go, you're too slow, wacka-wacka. Straw hat, spiky yellow glowing hair, black notebook. I'm really having a bad time as these popular works are not filling me with determination… (6/27/25 \- 4:55 pm)

* (STY-"T2") How words mean different things. Like having "unlimited knowledge"; does that mean having all knowledge? One can correctly argue that we all have unlimited knowledge, yet, if you are in a community where "unlimited" means "all", then your argument is wrong. — "**...with our unlimited knowledge, we wi-"** // "Pfft\! This guy thinks we have unlimited knowledge. Did he actually say that? Hey, you know that's ironic how you limited yourself by believing we all have unlimited knowledge, right? haha…" // **"What…?"** — Pretty interesting how I just thought of this when I saw "unlimited knowledge" while watching **\[XE\]** doing a "Would you Rather". (5/24/25 \- 4:57 pm)

* (STY-"T") What if I lied about everything? What if I stole **\[R'\]**, and made it mine? (4/27/25 \- 4:58 pm)

* (STY-"T4") The fact that I brought this **\[XE\]** idea from my timeline document. An explosion of history, so many pointers like **\[M\]**, **\[+\]**, and of course, **\[XE\]**. The belief that I must include everything, even the parts I erased when I first created the information a long time ago. But now, the belief is turned here, in the world of excerpts. It's the great **X'eradication**. (7/20/25 \- 4:59 pm)

---

 

* (STY-"T5") "But I don't want to read **\[R'\]**…" // "But it's good for you. You can learn many things from it." // "I'd rather read the **\[XE\]** than that piece of garbage…" (8/7/25 \- 5:03 am)

* (STY-"T6") (**Maela**… did you forget why all of this started? Don't you remember why you started writing excerpts in the first place?) The moments we made on the way, losing track of the path… because of identity, the complex concept of self. — Believes to be social: FALSE; Believes to be good at writing: FALSE; Believes to care about others opinions: TRUE; Believes to care about my own opinions, especially these opinions I have just previously told myself in this excerpt: TRUE; Believes to procrastinate: TRUE. — What do I believe? The more I would change myself, the more I would prove that who I believe I am right now isn't good enough, which makes me believe who I am is a failure? Fluidity, how we can easily change our identities… I don't want to lose myself, and I don't want to prove myself that who I am is bound to lose. — The power to tell ourselves who we are… if we can truly be anything, then would identity be meaningless? Upon that dark shimmer river, I want to prove that I don't need to force myself to turn, that I don't need to force myself to change who I am- — Believes they are good at writing: FALSE. — I won't change… I am tired… I won't change… I am tired… I won't change… Too much brain power, so I sleep. — But what if I'm not tired? But what if I'm not tired. But what if I'm not tired? — The thoughts, how the people would see me. Trying to write philosophically, yet I sound like some kid. The thoughts drag me down, they drag me down until my brain tells me to sleep… — But what if I'm not tired. What if I'm tired but no. I'm tire I sleep . let me watch that world of love again .(9/28/25 \- 5:06 pm)

* (STY-"T3") Ideas that bring excerpts, *\<these pieces of text right here in this \_TL project\>,* to life. A struggle, for the memory is shattered, pieces mixed in the pile of other shattered memories. The core theme of the idea is hard to see anymore… (7/2/25 \- 5:07 pm)

* (STY-"Understanding") The way to create characters as a true resemblance to something so thought-provoking. Something paradoxical and society splitting… or something connected to nothingness and absolute infinity. (3/26/25 \- 5:08 pm)

* (STY-"Eiahen") The story of loyalty, and how we all try to destroy it. *\<Heh… look at past **Maela** talking about this crap after she got rejected by a person she liked. Could never be me…\>* (11/7/25 \- 5:11 pm)

* (STY-"Ham") “It’s Xeradus\!”, yelled **\[XE\]**. **Xeradus’s** name was called, thus he opened his giant eye and revealed his terrifying sharp teeth. Small eyes started to open where the darkness started to spread. (5/20/23 \- 5:13 pm)

* (STY-"T4") Bahn Chords — the chords trains make. (8/2/25 \- 5:16 pm)

* (STY-"T3") Did I forget what **\[R'\]** is? It's a competition against absolutely everything. How can it be a competition of everything if I don't include everything? The skills, morality, clichés, art, politics, history, personalities, mythologies, ideologies from fiction and nonfiction. — Even though it's technically impossible, the amount of themes may just be uncountable in a realistic sense. (7/7/25 \- 5:17 pm)

* (STY-"||") Years ago, there used to be a peaceful alien world called **\[XE\]** *\<The peaceful alien world was called Magolia\>* . Each **\[XE\]**... Once upon a time, there world called **\[XE\]**… Long ago, there was a city called **\[XE\]**, the biggest city of the world. One man, with the name of **\[U\]**, was a soulless scientist. He studied the fields of space, dimensions, and universes. He was considered, the best scientist in history. (2/18/22 \- 5:18 pm)

* (STY-"Understanding") "Oh yeah, I will work on the story tomorrow…" — "Oh yeah, too tired, maybe tomorrow…" — "WHEN will I do it\!?", I say as I choose to watch **\[XE\]** when I could work on it now. (3/26/25 \- 5:19 pm)

* (STY-"T2") "Doctor Mask" sounds fire as a character. A plague doctor mask would remind others of "Doctor Mask". (5/23/25 \- 5:21 pm)

* (STY-"Understanding") The history of my work shouldn't only be interpreted by me. The people, including me and the characters in the story of **\[R'\]**, should rise along trying to understand what my work means. (3/26/25 \- 5:22 pm)

* (STY-"Histj**\[R'\]**") The spread of the CEPT, "Concentration of Exceptional Proselytism for Tranquility". CEPTs: — CEPT / ZL (**Zirkum Lemniskaruvo**) (4/19/24 \- 5:24 pm)

* (STY-"T2") The idea of escapism, the biggest drug, the drug that influences the main reason we use drugs. *\<We\!? What do you mean "we"\!?\>* (5/26/25 \- 5:26 pm)

* (STY-"T") When one gives you hope, something that makes you believe your work has done something special. That faith and inspiration that makes you continue and probably, although it could have all been a misinterpretation. (5/4/25 \- 5:27 pm)

* (STY-"T3") The idea of **\[XE\]** wanting to create the "Greatest Robot" was brought up before I thought of making **\[R'\]** the "Greatest of All Time" (6/21/25 \- 5:28 pm)

 

* (STY-"T3") A weapon, doomsday, maybe Dekauemiesus or even worse. But it's hidden away, maybe untouched forever. Waiting to be revealed, when **\[R'\]** finally unleashes its final smash, only if **\[R'\]**it "has forms". (6/25/25 \- 5:31 pm)

* (STY-"Ham") The **\[XE\]** …is the matriarchy of **\[XE\]**… …**\[XE\]**... is a matriarchy where …godly **\[XE\]**… women with special blood must change the reality to how they want. Every 30 years, a new young women must take the place as the holder of reality. (5/18/23 \- 5:32 pm)

(PRJ) Piano GM (This project was for my art portfolio. The audio and program, including its MIDI scripts, were both created by me with a MIDI-keyboard, FL Studio, and GameMaker. The video was recorded with ffmpeg-python, which is free — only if you know how to use it) (The audio is one of **\[ENA\]**'s themes slowed down) [(LINK)](https://dekauermaelab.github.io/Public/PRJ/piano.mp4) (11/26/25 \- 5:33 pm)

* (STY-"T3") …But there is something weird to understand. Imagine there were four men, who all believed on their own made up god. The four are the only ones who know that god. Now, they all sacrifice themselves, for they believe they would connect with their god in an afterlife. Now the god doesn't exist upon our reality, since the four men who only knew about the god are dead. That begs the question: did the god really survive?  *\<Girl, get yo goofy oh out of here talking about gods\! Like, what do you know about gods?\>* (6/24/25 \- 5:34 pm)

* (STY-"Histj**\[R'\]**") There were "Utopian Sectors and Centers" of the **\[R'\]** Capital and Seized Provinces. (4/19/24 \- 5:35 pm)

* (STY-"T4") ("Okay\! You're better than me\! It wasn't a competition in the first place. All of this controversy and conflict, why do you have to be like this? Now that you're better than me, are you happy now?") — Controlled by the goal. It doesn't matter if it's selfish or not, but it does give me a great disadvantage if it is. — I'm bringing this game to them. Sure I'll probably get the money, but is it really worth it if it's not fun? (7/25/25 \- 5:36 pm)

* (STY-"Histjj**\[R'\]**") …with stories refurbished and told by **\[R'\]** – (4/19/24 \- 5:37 pm)

* (STY-"T") **\[ENA\]** is tired of the same **\[R'\]** leitmotif played in the music. However, she is bound to it. I couldn't think of anything original away from what used to be original. Thus, I created a theme for **\[ENA\]**: "Cliche". The identity of **\[R'\]** would stay… (4/30/25 \- 5:41 pm)

* (STY-"c (R')") **\[XE\]** contains about 10 crystals carrying magical powers. These crystals are called **XTALs**. (2/10/22 \- 5:42 pm)

* (STY-"T3") A game where you can speedrun. A game where you just jump right in, no stops. Challenges, like you can't jump. A new **\[R'\]** game (6/25/25 \- 5:44 pm)

* (STY-"Ham") …Our (or their, if your not me) goal **\[XE\]**… Their goal is to seize souls from the **Great Reality**, their parent reality where the **Creator** exists in. The Plan goes like this: — 1\. Create multiple realities for each **\[XE\]** that have different variables and values from each other. — 2\. Because the **\[XE\]** can't exist in those realities (why, because I said so), they will create their own avatar resembling themselves and make the inhabitants worship the avatar as their god. — 3\. …Since the **\[XE\]** are shaped from dark energy \[XE\]… …a Create series of di **\[XE\]**… Create one more **\[XE\]**. …An **\[XE\]** for the "soul" **\[XE\]**... soulless **\[XE\]**. (7/22/23 \- 5:45 pm)

* The Story of **\[R'\]** is aware that there will be other stories out there also aiming to become the greatest of all time as well. (4/26/25 \- 5:46 pm)

 

* (STY-"20Jan22") If you delete the file “Dark Matter” and start the game. There will be nothing there except **\[U\]** dancing on the screen. — There are heroes, and there are bad guys. Like always, the hero will win and the bad guys will return. — But now, that is over. The bad guys will win this time. Because the dark matter appeared. — Bad guys will get dominated by darkness, and they will get stronger and more powerful. (1/24/22 \- 5:48 pm)

* (STY-"T3") The Pyramids, left alone on Earth, tutalling and immovable as the others fail to steal them for themselves. But now, within the Dedistomnium, a great museum of everything, it's there. **\[ENA\]** wonders, **\[ENA\]** feels guilty, **\[ENA\]** wants a change. (6/12/25 \- 5:49 pm)

* (STY-"T2") Brainstorm\! Green Needle\! Brainstorm\! My mind talking… I can't hear it because my mind keeps talking. It knows what it hears, and because I am so used to following what I hear from others, I just listen to my mind and declare it true without thought. (5/31/25 \- 5:51 pm)

* (STY-"T") "Every single concept mentioned should be enhanced upon to diminish exceptionality, for everything will be or is already widespread across communities. One idea can never forever be unique, similar to how you can never say a value greater than any value, including the same value. A way to understand that there is always more", I said a few days ago. I believe many features and characteristics of the Story of **\[R'\]** are unique. Including how I believed that my story, being aware of creating its own culture to influence our own real culture, is unique. But, I keep forgetting about that quote I have said. My body cold, I learned that a familiar franchise **\[XE\]** already had used it. My body is cold, as I believe it would overshadow me. (4/26/25 \- 5:53 pm)

* (STY-"T2") **\[XE\]** — The **\[R'\]** Micronation. (5/25/25 \- 5:56 pm)

* (STY-"T6") Of course I don't have enough energy to write down everything I'm thinking. Ideas forgotten. Moments forgotten. Yet, one of the main reasons why I do this is the fact I want to make sure others know that I already have thought about these things before. ("Haha\! Already thought of that\!"). ("I'm always a step ahead"). ("Uh… 'two steps ahead', I guess…) Knowledge as money, how sad I am for the sake of forethought. It seems that I really want to be right. (10/24/25 \- 5:58 pm)

* (STY-"Eiahen") As I am writing this, I feel like I'm going nowhere. Hmm… (9/14/25 \- 5:59 pm)

* (STY-"c (R')") **Myla** wanted to help the hero, so she threw a heavy boulder at the rat. The rat went flying and **\[XE\]** was surprised. He went up to **Myla** and asked her her name. **Myla** didn’t want to say her real name, so she quickly made up the robot name: **\[XERT\]**. (2/10/22 \- 6:01 pm)

* (STY-"History of R'") …or the War of Athros and Exoins (4/23/24 \- 6:05 pm)

* (STY-"||") The **\[XE\]** flew off, trying to find some unknown thing called **Extals**. All of **\[XE\]** were invaded by the **\[XE\]**. They soon began to create more of their kind, by absorbing the light of human’s soul. When they tried to absorb **\[U\]**’s light, they noticed they couldn’t because he doesn’t have one. All of the humans who seen the Deleatians were terrified as heck, but **\[U\]** didn’t make any signs of fear. The **\[XE\]** were confused what to do with him, so they asked their leader, **\[XE\]** . (2/18/22 \- 6:07 pm)

* (STY-"History of R'") Humans were never allowed back on **\[XE\]** *\<Humans were never allowed back in Magolia\>*. The sun that shines upon **\[XE\]** would mutate humans into aliens if exposed long enough. (4/23/24 \- 6:08 pm)

* (STY-"T7") On the phone, reflecting on the excerpts, their meanings and interpretations, stories about who I am. **Xeradus** would watch her, **Maela's** body swaying farther and farther, every night, for he is scared of her pain to overcome. But **Maela** smiles, her body swaying closer and closer, a little bit of pride, great talents and skills, all because she knows she will always have **\[R'\]** on her side. (10/24/25 \- 6:12 pm)

* (STY-"Understanding") My teacher spared me, for although I got a passing grade, it is obvious that they changed it so I wouldn't fail. I thank them without conversation. However, meanwhile, the one who wants to see me as the perfect child. A problematic fiend that feeds off from others' anger. Of course, a hypocrite, as others, like me, do the same towards them. I am anxious because of the punishment. But, nothing would ever change me… (3/27/25 \- 6:13 pm)

 

* (STY-"T2") I am rushing to play a newly released STORY game, **\[XE\]**, trying to stay up playing it until I see absolutely everything, but why? The Internet, the people. They would spoil and destroy that feeling of wanting to play the game, because why would you play if you already know what's going to happen… — The other games, different from story games, deal with self-worth. The competitive games, challenging games, all for the journey to win, to look exceptional and worthy towards the others and themselves. But the more you think about it, story games are like this as well, but in a different way. For story games, knowledge is the score. Knowledge of the lore, mystery, something that makes you think you're exceptional and worthy as no one else understands. — This really concludes that all games, any game you can possibly think of, is all about self-worth. One could say it's about having fun, but fun is progress. The progress on becoming worthy. — I stopped to think. Now writing this excerpt. I shouldn't be playing this game for the sake of this illusion. Ugh, he was right. (6/4/25 \- 6:15 pm)

She instantly became terrified tried to find a safe place to hide. While she was running, she accidentally bumped into another alien. It was an old… (2/9/22 \- 6:21 pm)

* (STY-"Ham")“The greatest reality for us and **\[XE\]**"... "The creator of …**\[R'\]** **\[XE\]**… the **\[XE\]** Book has rested this reality in what they call a 'video-game'. In the divine book, it says that the most of the intellectual inhabitants of the Great Reality’s world were set to crave 'video-games' by its **\[XE\]**.

* (STY-"T3") How people team up, stack up, win in games and make beginners feel like garbage. But of course, the beginners would just say that 'it's just a game' and 'Go outside\! Touch some grass\!". But what if those games were the standard way of life? All of reality as we know it, all changed into a raging, competitive game that makes noobs want to kill themselves? — Inspired by **\[XE\]**, and how chaotic they are. (6/23/25 \- 6:26 pm)

 

* (STY-"Understanding") These thoughts should be compared with others' thoughts, even though I technically do that. I should go on a platform like Reddit and find out what they believe. (4/2/25 \- 6:28 pm)

* (STY-"Eiahen") ("But what if it wasn't?") It feels great to find out that you didn't leave something behind, or that you have extras, something to back you up. But what if it wasn't there? Always expecting to have it, what if you just suddenly didn't have it? What would you do? (11/26/25 \- 6:29 pm)

* (STY-"T3") ("We want to create things to fix problems") — "If we want to create art, then what is the problem? It's the absence of our honor. Creating art helps us communicate, as we earn pride and acceptance towards the people, both bringing self-acceptance. It's the only reason we create art, and we wouldn't need it if it wasn't for society." — "\*melodically\* WROOOONG\!" — distinctions (signs), patterns (understanding things are similar), novelty… — "Ok, wait a minute. What?" (7/1/25 \- 6:42 pm)

* (STY-"T2") **\[R'\]**, controlled, a protagonist, a hero. The crazy moments, insane moments that break through the limits of our nature. Powerful, yet relatable, the aura. Not just a superhero movie, but a classic. — In a hidden area, connected with the lore from years ago, the human body, stored in a hidden room. It was trapped, an experiment, one soul's placed into another's body. But that other body, made out of a light blue metal– a successful experiment. Stuck in the alien world, it was The **\[R'\]**.

* (STY-"Understanding") Being in a restaurant, no bother of thinking philosophically as your mind is blinded from the goal. Losing focus… *\<Are you trying to be a philosopher or something?

A clear view of how you look like, smell like, sound like towards everyone else, because you're now everyone else? It's basically impossible to grasp that understanding" (**Maela** would like to say this, but she doesn't) "**Maela**, put your phone away. … Put your phone away" (She believes everyone else sees her as unworthy.

The world, no longer organic, our paths that consist of hope and emotion are discarded as we taught ourselves how to only see the main picture. The magic became science, fun all manufactured, absence of spiritual power, absence of purpose. — The feeling of power, that stuff that makes things special… Where is the power to control what things should be special and what things should not?
